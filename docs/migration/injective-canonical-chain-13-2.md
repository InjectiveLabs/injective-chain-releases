# Injective v1.13.2 Upgrade ü•∑

## Upgrade Guide


This is a software upgrade proposal for Injective. If passed, [Proposal 424](https://hub.injective.network/proposal/424/) would commit the Injective Chain to halt at block [82830000](https://www.mintscan.io/injective/blocks/82830000) (approximately 15:00 UTC on Thursday August 20th 2024) and resume with the v1.13.2 version of the application binary.

Validators can find a step-by-step guide on the upgrade procedure in the long-form [proposal](https://docs.injective.network/nodes/validators/mainnet/canonical_chain_upgrade/canonical-1.13.2).

Validators should also upgrade the peggo version.
