# Injective v1.13.0 Upgrade ü•∑

## Upgrade Guide


This is a software upgrade proposal for Injective. If passed, [Proposal 420](https://hub.injective.network/proposals/420/) would commit the Injective Chain to halt at block [80319200](https://www.mintscan.io/injective/blocks/80319200) (approximately 14:00 UTC on Thursday August 1st 2024) and resume with the v1.13.0 version of the application binary.

Validators can find a step-by-step guide on the upgrade procedure in the long-form [proposal](https://docs.injective.network/nodes/validators/mainnet/canonical-chain-upgrade/canonical-1.13.0).

Validators should also upgrade the peggo version.
