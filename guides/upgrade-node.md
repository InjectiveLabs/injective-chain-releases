# Upgrading your Injective Chain Node

To upgrade your node, follow these steps:
1. Sync your node to the block height predetermined by the upgrade governance proposal.
2. The node will automatically panic/stop at the predetermined upgrade height.
3. Remove the old binaries and install the new release binaries.
4. Restart the node.

See [here][release-versions] for the most recent and prior releases.
