# Sync From a Snapshot

Syncing from a snapshot is the easiest and quickest way to sync the injective node.

Follow the process [here](https://docs.injective.network/nodes/RunNode/mainnet), or use a  [sync script](../scripts/README.md).

Daily archival snapshots are available on [ChainLayer/QuickSync](https://quicksync.io/networks/injective.html).

**NOTE:**  You always have the option to sync your sentry from scratch via public sentries, which is a more decentralized approach. However, the process is quite complex and involves running a node with multiple binaries (starting from the first Injective release) and upgrading at certain block heights.
